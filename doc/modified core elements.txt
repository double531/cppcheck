line: 216 added string for raw code (needed to get the code from the preprocessor in the subsequent instances)

file: cppcheck/lib/cppcheck.cpp
line: 150+ overhand raw code by reference to an overloaded preprocessor function (which fills the raw code object)
      362 call overloaded tokenize function with the raw code (after that the raw code is no longer needed)


file: cppcheck/lib/preprocessor.h
line: 93 overloaded the regular preprocess function to fill a string by reference
      99 overloaded the read function (gets called within preprocess) to get the raw code
      248 implemented handleIncludesRaw as a modified version of the regular function to process the include tree with raw code

file: cppcheck/lib/preprocessor.cpp
line: 335+ extraction of the raw code and simple adjustments - the raw code gets just extracted before the comments get removed (removeComments)


file: cppcheck/lib/token.h
line: 55 added 2 new types: eComment and eIndent for those specific tokens
      278 implemented isSingleLine function for eComment tokens

file: cppcheck/lib/token.cpp
line: 114 added correct detection of comments as eComment type


file: cppcheck/lib/tokenize.h
line: 89 modified tokenize function to accept raw code for the token generation if desired
      744+ added the custom token list as a separate token list containing all tokens derived from the raw code + the regular ones (can be accessed in the check class)

file: cppcheck/lib/tokenize.cpp
line 2086+ implemented the complete procedure to add the regular token list to the custom one


file: cppcheck/lib/tokenlist.h
line 55 implemented addCustomToken function for the creation of the custom tokens from raw code (gets called within createTokens)
     68+ modified the regular createTokens function to accept raw code and call the createTokensRaw function (which builds up the custom tokens)
     143+ added the front and back for the custom token list

file: cppcheck/lib/tokenlist.cpp
line 425 createTokensRaw is the function where all the custom tokens get created - PLACE TO IMPLEMENT THE DETECTION AND CREATION OF NEW TOKENS
